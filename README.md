# Data_Wrangling_Project_and_Tasks

This repository contains my final project for QBS181 Final, as well as other projects from throughout the course. This repo is meant to be an overview of the work I have done and allows viewers to easily observe what I have done. In all cases outputs and intermediate results have been suppressed.

Each project is located in its own sub-directory and each sub-directory is summarized below. A statement is also provided on my permission to make this work public.

## project1

This subdirectory contains the SQL script used for our first project. For each question a new table is made by modifying existing tables, then random rows would be outputted if the script were run.

## project2

This subdirectory contains the compiled R-Markdown PDF for our second project. I utilize the odbc package for R to make SQL queries into R, then modify them using R packages. Per the instructions, I have suppressed all the output generated from the code chunks so no data is shown.

## project3

This subdirectory contains the R script used for our third project. For each question I construct tables containing the information requested.

## midterm_project

This subdirectory contains the compiled R-Markdown PDF for our midterm project. I utilize the odbc package for SQL commands as well as R packages to clean-up a messy dataset of diabetes data. Before doing so, I address the issues in the data and how I plan to fix them. Per the instructions, I have suppressed all the output generated from the code chunks so no data is shown.

## final_project

This subidrectory contains the compiled R-Markdown PDF for our final project. I utilize mostly R packages to clean up a BP dataset, with some SQL commands using odbc. I also demonstrate how the same table can be created in SQL or R. I have suppressed all the output generated from the code chunks so no data is shown.
